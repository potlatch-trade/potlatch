# Potlatch

**Potlatch** is a hybrid protocol enabling perfect strangers to anonymously trade in tangible goods. This repository serves as both the canonical archive for encrypted dispatches and the evolving development site for the protocolâ€™s specification, logic, and tooling.

## ðŸ§¾ Dispatches

All dispatches are encrypted `.gpg` files stored in [`dispatches/encrypted/`](dispatches/encrypted).  
Each dispatch has an associated `SHA256` hash stored in [`dispatches/hashes/`](dispatches/hashes) for public verification.

To verify a dispatch:

```bash
sha256sum dispatches/encrypted/001-init.gpg
cat dispatches/hashes/001-init.sha256
